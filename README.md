# Google_Advanced_Data_Course_2_Project
Google Advanced Data Analytics Course 2 - Getting Started with Python project lab for the Automatidata Project.

Welcome to the Automatidata Project!

You have just started as a data professional in a fictional data analytics firm, Automatidata. Their client, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), has hired the Automatidata team for its reputation in helping their clients develop data-based solutions.

The team is still in the early stages of the project. Previously, you were asked to complete a project proposal by your supervisor, DeShawn Washington. You have received notice that your project proposal has been approved and that New York City TLC has given the Automatidata team access to their data. To get clear insights, New York TLC's data must be analyzed, key variables identified, and the dataset ensured it is ready for analysis.

A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the questions inside and prepare a summary for the data team. -  description taken from Google, Coursera.
